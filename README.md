# üè¶ Loan Default Risk Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project predicts the risk of loan default using a **üå≥ Decision Tree Classifier**, trained on the **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset (Kaggle).  

üìä An interactive **Streamlit** app is included for testing the model with custom inputs.

## üìä **Dataset**

- **Source:** [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)
- **File:** `application_train.csv`
- **Rows:** ~307,000
- **Features:** 120+ raw ‚Üí ~180+ after feature engineering
- **Target:** `TARGET` (1 = Defaulted, 0 = Paid Back)

---

## üìú **Workflow**

**Data Understanding & Preprocessing**
- Removed columns with >50% missing values.
- Filled numeric missing with median, categorical with mode.
- Encoded categorical features (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding).
- Final shape: ~307,511 rows √ó ~181 columns.

**Feature Engineering**
- Age and employment: `AGE`, `YEARS_EMPLOYED`, `AGE_EMPLOYED_RATIO`
- Financial ratios: `CREDIT_INCOME_RATIO`, `ANNUITY_INCOME_RATIO`, `ANNUITY_CREDIT_RATIO`
- Social circle, contact, flags, and regional features.
- Outlier detection & skewness check.

**Model Training**
- Split: Train / Validation / Test
- Tuned Decision Tree (criterion, max_depth).
- Unpruned tree: ~73% accuracy, slight overfitting.
- Pruned tree & Random Forest used for comparison.

**Deployment**
- Streamlit app for live predictions.
- User enters key features.
- Model uses full feature pipeline for prediction.
- Output: Probability & class (Default or No Default).
